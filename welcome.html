<h1>CSS test for Junior Application Developer </h1>
<h2>Rhode Island Secretary of State</h2>
<p>
Working for the Rhode Island Secretary of State is very rewarding.  There are many challenges for junior and senior level developers alike.  Be ready to take on lots of responsibility very quickly.  We will be moving fast and we will have high expectations regardless of where you currently are in your career.
</p>
<p>
If you are someone who wants to learn and improve your skills, while also making government more accessible to Rhode Islander's, this is an ideal place to work.  You will be expected to work with civic groups such as Code America and Code Island.  You will learn the inner workings of state government, and you will become a better programmer and developer.
